// This question is asked by Google. Given two integer arrays, return their intersection.
// Note: the intersection is the set of elements that are common to both arrays.

const numIntersection = (nums1, nums2) => {
  // Your Code Here
};

// Ex: Given the following arrays...
console.log(numIntersection([2, 4, 4, 2], [2, 4])); // => return [2, 4]
console.log(numIntersection([1, 2, 3, 3], [3, 3])); // => return [3]
console.log(numIntersection([2, 4, 6, 8], [1, 3, 5, 7])); // => return []
