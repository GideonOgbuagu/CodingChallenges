// Write a function that returns the factorial of a number. A factorial of a number is the result of that number multiplied by the number before it, and the number before that number, and so on, until you reach 1. The factorial of 1 is just 1.
// Example factorial of 4 is 4*3*2*1 = 24
// Please use a recursive function to solve this.

const factorial = (num) => {
  // Your Code Here
};

// Test Cases
let num = 5;
console.log(`Factorial of ${num} is: ${factorial(num)}`); // => 120

num = 8;
console.log(`Factorial of ${num} is: ${factorial(num)}`); // => 40320

num = 21;
console.log(`Factorial of ${num} is: ${factorial(num)}`); // => 51090942171709440000
