# Write a function that calculates the nth fibonnaci number recursively
# This solution should be optimize # of recursive calls added to stack using memoization
# Example Fibonnaci Sequence: 0,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...

def getNthFib(n):
    # Your Code Here
    return


# Test Cases
print(getNthFib(15))  # Should print: 377
print(getNthFib(25))  # Should print: 46368
print(getNthFib(9))  # Should print: 21
print(getNthFib(5))  # Should print: 3
